# Markdown Previewer

This repo is for the 'Build a Markdown Previewer' exercise from the Front End Development Libraries Projects on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#front-end-development-libraries-projects)

You can view this project on my GitHub pages: [duncan-s-white.github.io/markdown-previewer/](https://duncan-s-white.github.io/markdown-previewer/)

This was my first `react-create-app` project.

The project uses:
 - Class components.
 - Custom CSS to style in a windows 95 style, for fun!

Some dependencies used:
 - remarkable - for the conversion of the markdown to HTML
 - font awesome for icons
 - gh-pages to build and deploy to GitHub pages

## How to run locally

Clone the project to your machine. In the project directory, run the command:

`npm start`
