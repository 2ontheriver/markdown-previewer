# Markdown Previewer

This repo is for the 'Build a Markdown Previewer' exercise from the Front End Development Libraries Projects on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)

You can view this project on my GitHub pages: [duncan-s-white.github.io/markdown-previewer/](https://duncan-s-white.github.io/markdown-previewer/)

This was my first project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project uses:

- Class components.
- Custom CSS to style in a windows 95 style, for fun!

Some dependencies used:

- remarkable - for the conversion of the markdown to HTML
- fortawesome - for icons
- gh-pages - to build and deploy to GitHub pages

## How to run locally

Clone the project to your machine. In the project directory, to install dependencies run the command:

`npm install`

Then to run the app in development mode, run the command:

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
